**NAME :** Arun Bhagat

**MILESTONES ACHIEVED :** 

1. GOOGLE SEARCH RESULT'S FIRST URL
2. FLIPKART'S FIRST ITEM WITH PRICE AND IMAGE
3. COMPARING PRICE ACCROSS E-COMMERCE WEBSITES (FLIPKART, AMAZON AND SNAPDEAL)
4. OPTIONAL MILESTONES : GUI, SPECS OF ITEM AND REVIEW OF ITEM

**TECH STACK :**

1. PYTHON
2. BEAUTIFUL SOUP LIBRARY FOR SCRAPING
3. TKINTER LIBRARY FOR GUI

**DESCRIPTION**

The program consists of a simple search box for the user to input the required keyword/search-term and avail one of the three functionalities, one is a simple google search which quickly provides the title, link(clickable) and description of the first google search result, the second is a quick overview of the first item on Flipkart search along with it's name, image, price, aggregate rating, specifications and top two most helpful reviews, the third and final functionality provides the details of the first search result item of Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal. It can be used to quickly compare prices of items in the three websites as well as get an idea of the general ratings and reviews of the product on the three websites.

**UNIQUE**

- A neat and minimalist GUI with visible and contrasting colour scheme.
- A very easy to view and use button interface.
- Clickable hyperlink of Googles's first search result.
- A seperate image window to prevent clamoring of widgets and provide a convenient image viewing experience.
- A side by side comparison of ratings and price for the three websites.
- A button to view the top two ratings of each website in a new window.

**PROBLEMS FACED**

1. Creating the grid layout for the Tkinter GUI which I was completely new to.
2. Scraping the websites using User-Agents and proxies to get past the capcha page.
3. Making sure that if no items of the given name are found, then the program does not completely stop working.
4. reducing the clamoring of widgets and setting up new window for viewing images and reviews.

**SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT**

I wanted to design the GUI more to make it look attractive as well as include a palette of images for each product, however, I was not able to do this due to the time crunch faced as I was completely new to web-scraping and Tkinter GUI.

**WHAT YOU LEARNED?**

This is my first ever python project so I developed quite an understanding of using python for development and attained practial experience. I also got a thorough understanding of Web-Scraping, HTTP Requests, User-Agents and Tkinter library.
